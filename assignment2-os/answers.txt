1) Explanation of the Code Examples 
----------------------------------------------------

Example 1: Basic fork()
This program creates a new child process using fork(). After the fork call, two processes exist: the parent and the child. The child process prints its own process ID, and the parent prints the ID of the child. Each process follows a different path depending on the value returned by fork.

Example 2: fork() with wait()
This program creates a child process that runs for two seconds and prints messages. The parent process waits for the child to finish using the wait() function. This ensures that the child finishes completely before the parent continues, preventing zombie processes and keeping execution synchronized.

Example 3: fork() with execvp()
In this example, the child process does not continue executing C code after the fork. Instead, it replaces itself with another program using execvp(). The child runs the external command "ls". The parent waits until the child finishes running the exec command before it continues.

Example 4: Multiple forks
This program contains two fork() calls. The first fork creates two processes, and the second fork doubles them again, resulting in four running processes. Each one prints its own process ID. The example demonstrates how multiple forks expand the number of running processes.

2) What is the Linker?
----------------------------------------------------
The linker is the tool responsible for combining multiple object files (such as .o files) into a final executable program. It resolves symbols between files, connects function calls to their definitions, links the program with external libraries, and assigns final memory addresses needed for execution.

----------------------------------------------------
3) What is the Loader?
----------------------------------------------------
The loader is part of the operating system. Its job is to load the executable from storage into memory when the user runs a program. It prepares the program's memory layout, including text, data, heap, and stack segments. It also performs dynamic linking when required and then transfers control to the program’s entry point so it can start running.
